A simple website for a local business

## Introduction
My hair stylist needed a website, so I created this template for her business.  I decided to hand-code everything, making use of CSS Grid in many of the components.  I was especially excited to implement my favorite form control styles: floating labels.  I decided to use jQuery for the few JavaScript components, including the hidden navigation menu and the floating labels on the contact form.
